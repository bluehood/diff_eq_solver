This project would be a simple and easy-to-expand framework
for the numerical resolution of differential equations of the
form dX/dt = F(t,X), where X and F may be vectors, and t is a 
scalar. The great majority of motions can be described by equations
of such form.

The project makes extensive use of STL and c++11 standard. You will
not be able to compile any of the source files without a compiler 
that supports the new standard. You MIGHT be able to compile the 
libraries with a compiler different from gcc (modifying the makefile
should be straighforward) but I never used anything else so you're on
your own.

libplotter.a, the library containing the RTPlotter and MPlotter 
classes, requires the CERN ROOT framework to be installed on your 
system to be compiled and to work. The command `root-config` must be 
accessible by the makefile.
If this is not the case, you can still compile libsolver.a, 
containing the classes that actually solve differential equations 
numerically, by using the command `makefile all_noroot`.

The 'examples' directory provides sample snippets of code that use 
all major functionalities of the different classes.

Special thanks go to Tp for alfa testing this framework and
providing some of the most interesting examples.
